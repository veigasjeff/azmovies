    "news1":"The Killer Trailer: Nathalie Emmanuel Transforms into a Deadly Assassin in John Woo’s Classic Action Movie Remake  \n\n In our opinion, a new action film starring Nathalie Emmanuel from Game of Thrones and Omar Sy from Lupin is always worth a hearty 'Woo!'. But a new action film featuring the pair that is also a remake of a Chow Yun-Fat genre staple? That's worthy of John Woo! And that's precisely what we get in the high-octane debut trailer for The Killer, the famed action director's forthcoming (and long-awaited) remake of his own 1989 bullet ballet hit.\n\n Flying doves? Check. Spectacular gun-fu? Check. Operatic slow-motion explosions? Check. It’s clear: John Woo is back! After his triumphant return to Hollywood with last year’s 'Silent Night,' his first Hollywood film in twenty years, Woo is upping the ante with his latest project. This new venture brings a story from his Hong Kong action heyday into the 21st century with explosive flair. \n\n The stylish new trailer showcases Nathalie Emmanuel as Zee, a trench-coated assassin sporting a wide-brimmed hat. This gender-swapped take on Chow Yun-Fat's role from the original film highlights Emmanuel's character, known as the 'Queen of the Dead.' In a Parisian nightclub, Zee demonstrates her deadly skills, making it rain bullets and inciting the wrath of Parisian crime boss Eric Cantona (yes, the former football star!). The trailer also reveals a thrilling cat-and-mouse game between Zee and Omar Sy’s relentless detective. \n\n ",

    "news2":"'A standout moment in the trailer features Zee confidently declaring, 'Never send boys to do a woman's job,' while performing acrobatic stunts, vaulting gravestones, and leaping with guns blazing in a cathedral. This scene alone is worth highlighting for its sheer Woo-nderful kick-assery. \n\n For those unfamiliar with the original film, here’s a brief synopsis to get you up to speed: Zee is a mysterious and infamous assassin known, and feared, in the Parisian underworld as the Queen of the Dead. During an assignment from her shadowy mentor and handler, played by Sam Worthington, Zee refuses to kill a blinded young woman (Diana Silvers) in a Paris nightclub. This decision shatters Zee’s alliances, draws the attention of a savvy police investigator (Omar Sy), and plunges her into a sinister criminal conspiracy. This entanglement sets Zee on a collision course with her own past. \n\n Woo’s new adaptation promises to deliver the same high-octane action and stylistic flair that made the original a classic. With Emmanuel’s Zee at the center, the film explores themes of loyalty, betrayal, and redemption within the criminal underworld. The inclusion of Eric Cantona as a crime boss adds an intriguing layer, showcasing his transition from the football field to the silver screen. Cantona's character is poised to be a formidable antagonist, providing a fresh dynamic to the story. \n\n",

    "news3":" Omar Sy’s portrayal of the determined detective adds another layer of intensity. His character’s pursuit of Zee will likely lead to explosive confrontations and dramatic showdowns. The cat-and-mouse dynamic between Zee and the detective is a classic Woo element, promising tension and excitement throughout the film.    \n\n  John Woo’s return to Hollywood with 'Silent Night' was a significant event, and 'The Killer' seems set to solidify his comeback. The film not only pays homage to the original but also reimagines it for a new generation, combining Woo’s iconic action sequences with contemporary storytelling. The decision to cast Nathalie Emmanuel as the lead is inspired, offering a fresh perspective while staying true to the spirit of the original. \n\n        \n\n  We’ll discover if this new version of 'The Killer lives up to its legendary predecessor when it premieres on Peacock on August 23. With John Woo at the helm, expectations are high, and fans eagerly await the release. Release the doves and get ready for a cinematic experience that promises to be both nostalgic and thrilling! \n\n",

    "news1":"Continuing his silver screen stride, co-writer Glen Powell stars in Hit Man, the latest from filmmaker and Academy Award-nominee Richard Linklater (Boyhood). To discuss his dark comedy, Linklater stopped by Collider’s studio at the Cinema Center by MARBL at this year’s Toronto International Film Festival and sat down with Editor-in-Chief Steve Weintraub.  \n\n Far removed from his suave Top Gun: Maverick role, Powell flexes his comedic range as Gary Johnson, a timid philosophy professor who moonlights as a staff investigator for undercover cops. When one of the officers impersonating a hitman is placed on leave, it’s Gary’s time to shine. Because he most resembles the officer, Gary is asked to step in for the operation, and it’s undercover as a killer that this professor blossoms. While meeting with a possible client, the charismatic hitman, “Ron,” hits it off with Madison (played by Adria Arjona), a woman looking for a way to escape her abusive relationship. When Gary steps out of bounds and starts meeting up with Madison, he begins to fumble his juggling act with all his new personas, and someone truly does wind up dead. \n\n During their sit-down, Linklater discusses reuniting with Powell for this foray into the “film noir genre and the screwball comedy,” how they landed on this idea, and collaborating together on the story. He talks about the outrageous looks Powell dons for the movie, how a coffee date signaled Arjona was their perfect Madison, and the more technical side of movie magic. Linklater also touches on the impact of Dazed and Confused, more Before Sunrise films, and “shapeshifting” in the editing room. \n\n Critics have been buzzing about Richard Linklater’s Hit Man since it premiered at festivals last year. A charming mix of screwball and noir, the film takes inspiration from the real-life story of Gary Johnson, a schoolteacher who for years moonlighted as a pretend hit man in Houston, helping local police entrap folks who would reach out to him to order a killing. Hit Man stars Glen Powell, who also wrote the script with Linklater, and it adds a sexy twist to the true tale. In the movie, Gary falls for one of his targets—a beautiful woman (played by Adria Arjona) who asks him to kill her abusive husband. A game of secrets, twists, and multiple identities follows, as dark and thrilling as it is hilarious.  \n\n On today’s episode, Linklater joins Film Comment Editor Devika Girish to discuss the movie’s genesis, how it draws unexpectedly from his activism for criminal justice reform, his fascination with the flexibility of identity, and his underrated talent for writing great twists.

    "news2":"'Hit Man,' which impressed critics and crowds at the Venice and New York Film Festivals, will almost likely find an audience, but it will not be released in cinemas or at the box office. That's because the film's marketing and PR team saw its restricted, two-week, 45-screen, 20-city theatrical release as only a prelude to what they see as the film's true premiere: streaming on Netflix. \n\n The problem for Linklater isn't Netflix, its business, or the fact that the corporation stepped in and purchased 'Hit Man,' paying an estimated $20 million after its Venice premiere.'How about Universal or Warner Bros.?' In an interview with IndieWire, Linklater stated, 'I look at the studios if anyone wants to cast blame.' The indie cinema [scene] appears to have the same ambitions that it has always had: to present films and hope to find an audience someplace. For me, the studio world has altered the most. They've abandoned a form of filmmaking. They are no longer interested in creating this sort of film. They aren't interested in adult entertainment.",

    "news3":"To Linklater's point, it's not difficult to envisage a recent past in which a studio would have created, produced, and released a potential crowdpleaser like 'Hit Man.' But what disappointed Linklater was how increasingly risk-averse studios abandoned a completed product after it had been successfully tested. It was a very mild bidding situation; they could have had us, said Linklater. But this wasn't just a script rejection; they rejected it as a polished picture with crowds clapping and critical response. They looked at it and remarked, 'Mmmm, this isn't what we do.'This prompts Linklater to inquire, So the real question here is, the studios need to explain: 'OK, well, so what do you want?' He understands it's a rhetorical question and answers it himself; it's established IP. They are afraid of our uniqueness in the face of changing times.' To me, that's what's changed: they've found out what they don't do, and that's the world we knew. Undoubtedly, the globe has shrunk. You need the middle to step up, but right now, it's Netflix, and streamers are in that sector.' I have never been adept at industry analysis. I simply know, having had my toe in the industry for 30 years or so, it's always changing, it's always sort of shady [laughs], and everyone is always tense because it's threatened, Linklater added. Every time I have the opportunity to finally make a movie, I'm overjoyed since I've been on the bench here and there for the past 30 years, unable to get what I wanted done and having to change to something else. This may be irritating. So when everything looks to be falling into place and I can do my next picture, I'm ecstatic. \n\n And Linklater has a lot to be happy about lately, having been energized by recently shooting 'Nouvelle Vague,' his film about Jean-Luc Godard's transition from critic to director of 'Breathless,' and beginning another multiyear 'Boyhood'-like project with 'Merrily We Roll Along,' a 20-year production that he won't finish until he's in his early eighties. 'Hit Man' premieres on Netflix on June 7.",

    "news1":"The film Wild Wild Punjab, starring Varun Sharma, Sunny Singh, Manjot Singh, and Jassie Gill, is a collection of cliches about Punjabi men dealing with heartbreak, complete with fart jokes and body fluids.  \n\n Four Punjabi guys traveling from Pathankot to Patiala. Is it Patiala to Pathankot? Who cares? Because Wild Wild Punjab is nothing but a series of stereotypes about Punjabi ‘mundas’, and ‘kudis’: loud, brash, large-hearted, impulsive, pumped up on bravado and idiocy, doing the hook-up-break-up-drinking-shinking-bhangra-shangra-thing, with at least one monster SUV in the entourage, awash in noisome fart jokes and fluids from all sorts of nether parts. If you can tolerate the thought of 'Fukrey' light, this is it. \n\n You still with me? Okay, here we go. Khanne (Varun Sharma) has been dumped; the dumpee is about to marry, leaving the former heartbroken in the only way Punjabi fellows are allowed to, according to Bollywood: getting drunk and peeing on public property, which raises an urgent question: what were their doting mammas doing during toilet training? Or did they simply miss out on this crucial understanding? \n\n Arore (Sunny Singh) may dislike being labeled a sex-fiend, but given his eagerness to hook up with one lady after another in the backseat of a car, what can you say? Jainu (Jassie Gill) is under his greedy father's boot, who is busy counting the cash handed by the 'papaji' of Sonny Boy's would-be-'dulhan'. And Honey Paaji (Manjot Singh) is the type of softie who will summon his fleet of fifty trucks to the aid of any 'abla naari' if addressed as'veer ji'.  \n\n The film's sole purpose is to transform Khanne's enormous pity party (sob, people, she's left me) into a break-up 'tamasha'. The frenetic sprint to the'mandap' is punctuated by diversions intended to introduce fresh characters and twists, which would have succeeded if not so obviously copied. Remember the movie 'The Hangover', in which an all-night binge ends in disaster? ",

The sharpie (Ishita Raj), who believes vaping is not the same as smoking, is intended to contrast with the bashful bride, but remember what we said earlier? None of these characters stand out because they are all playing kinds. \n\n A jovial officer and a couple of drug traffickers are looking for a packet of white powder, and a few more join the fray. But it's all jaded and tedious. There will always be room for low-stakes, low-IQ comedies. When done correctly and, most significantly, with a refresh button, they can be great stress relievers.
