    "news1": "Tera Kya Hoga Lovely is a 2024 Indian Hindi-language social comedy film directed by Balwinder Singh Janjua and produced by Sony Pictures Films India. The film features Randeep Hooda and Ileana D'Cruz in lead roles and revolves around India's obsession with fair skin. It was theatrically released on 8 March 2024.\n\n The story follows Lovely, whose dark complexion is considered a curse in her life. The film highlights how a girl's complexion and dowry significantly impact her prospects for marriage. When a boy rejects Lovely because of her dark complexion, her father arranges her marriage with someone else for double the dowry. Problems arise when the dowry items are stolen, and a police officer becomes close to Lovely while trying to catch the thieves. \n\n Balwinder Singh Janjua, known for writing films like Saand Ki Aankh and Mubarakan, directed this film and co-wrote the story with Rupinder Chahal and Anil Rodhan. While the film tackles important social issues such as dowry and colorism, it does so in a light-hearted manner, which dilutes the original spirit of the story. As the film progresses towards comedy, it loses its grip on the serious issues it aims to address. \n\n Ileana D'Cruz, playing the role of Lovely, appears for the first time after the news of her becoming a mother. However, her performance does not align with her previous film choices, and she struggles to do justice to the character. The director's choice to cast her in this role is questionable, as a dark-skinned actress might have brought more authenticity to the portrayal of Lovely. \n\n Sony Pictures released this film strategically before the release of Randeep Hooda's first film as a producer and director, Swatantrya Veer Savarkar, hoping to capitalize on the hype around him. While Randeep's Haryanvi accent is commendable, the director fails to extract the best performance from him. Among the rest of the cast, Geetika Vidya, playing a newly married constable, delivers a better performance than Ileana, but Pawan Malhotra disappoints in the role of Lovely's father. Varun Sharma's participation in the film is puzzling, and Karan Kundra and Sunil Dahiya's performances are average. \n\n Overall, Tera Kya Hoga Lovely received negative reviews from critics, who criticized the direction, writing, and performances. Despite its significant themes, the film's execution falls short, resulting in a missed opportunity to address serious societal issues effectively. ",

    "news1": "The Family Star is a 2024 Indian Telugu-language romantic action drama film written and directed by Parasuram, and produced by Dil Raju and Sirish under Sri Venkateswara Creations. The film stars Vijay Deverakonda and Mrunal Thakur in lead roles. The film was officially announced in February 2023 under the tentative title VD11, as it is Vijay's 11th film as the lead actor. The official title, 'The Family Star,' was announced in October 2023. Principal photography commenced in July 2023 and took place in various locations including Hyderabad and New York. The film's music was composed by Gopi Sundar. Initially scheduled for a Sankranthi release, the film's release was postponed to avoid clashing with other Sankranthi films.\n\n Indu (Mrunal Thakur) sadly sits in the middle of a ceremony and, when questioned about her unusual behavior, she tells a story about her past. Govardhan (Vijay Deverakonda) is a family man who works in a business to provide for his family. He faces trouble with his brother, who is a drunkard. Govardhan meets Indu when she moves into his 'space' and they quickly become friends, eventually falling in love. After a big incident, Govardhan reconciles with his brother after his mother reveals to Indu that his brother hated him because Govardhan shamed him. However, when Govardhan finds Indu's thesis on his family and him for a college project, he slaps her and vows to teach her a lesson. He goes to a previous job offeror (Jagapathi Babu), requests to join the company, and asks for a big advance. He uses that advance to defy whatever Indu has written in her thesis. However, it is revealed that Indu is actually the daughter of the company's head. Though annoyed, Govardhan continues working in the company but demands everything Indu gets. After learning that his flight tickets weren't paid for, he resorts to Indu, who provides money for his family. After falling in love again, Indu hears Govardhan talking negatively about her to another woman, saying she isn't the right person for him. Heartbroken, Indu isolates herself from him and eventually leaves after confronting him. \n\n Govardhan later finds out Indu's true intentions behind writing the thesis from her father and proceeds to stop her from a wedding, held for a person who got injured due to Govardhan and, according to the person's grandfather, a famous politician, would be the only thing to make him feel better. It is revealed that Indu is at that wedding. Govardhan defeats the politician's goons along with his mother, wins back Indu, and marries her at the end. \n\n The Family Star received generally negative reviews from critics, who criticized Parasuram's writing and direction, weak comedy, plot, predictability, soundtrack, and the lead cast's performances. The film was a box office bomb, grossing only ₹19.78–23.20 crore against a budget of ₹50 crore. \n\n  ",

    "news1": "Wild Eyed and Wicked is an indie film that uniquely blends horror, drama, and fantasy to tell a compelling story about Lily, a young woman grappling with her traumatic past. The narrative takes us through Lily's journey of coping with her childhood trauma, represented metaphorically by a medieval monster. Despite its flawed execution and a tedious first half, the film eventually finds its footing, delivering a story that resonates on a deeper level.\n\n The movie opens by highlighting Lily's traumatic experience of witnessing her mother's suicide as a child. This event sets the stage for her lifelong struggle with trauma and her complicated relationship with her estranged father, an aloof history professor. Lily, now in her twenties, works as a fencing instructor and is in a budding relationship with her girlfriend, Willow. Despite Willow's positive influence, Lily's unresolved trauma continues to cast a shadow over her life, manifesting in sleepwalking episodes where she becomes destructive. \n\n On the 20th anniversary of her mother's death, Lily's father invites her to their old home to go through her mother's belongings, a task he's finally ready to undertake. Their reunion is strained and uncomfortable, highlighting the emotional distance that has grown between them since her mother's death. The visit stirs up memories for Lily, both painful and pleasant, particularly the medieval tales her mother used to tell her. \n\n As Lily delves into her mother's past, she uncovers a trove of letters and a torn page from one of the storybooks. The tales of yellow-eyed demons, or 'inominatum metus' (nameless fear), start to blur the lines between fantasy and reality for Lily. These stories, once a source of comfort, now seem to hold a darker significance, reflecting the unresolved fears that haunt her. \n\n The film transitions from a drama about personal trauma to a fantasy where Lily must confront these medieval monsters, symbolizing her internal battles. Her father's revelation that Lily's existence contributed to her mother's unhappiness adds another layer to her emotional turmoil. However, it is through revisiting these stories and facing the 'nameless fear' that Lily begins to understand her past and find a way to heal.  \n\n Wild Eyed and Wicked may struggle with pacing and narrative coherence at times, but it ultimately succeeds in portraying a poignant story about trauma and the process of overcoming it. Lily's journey is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit, even when faced with seemingly insurmountable fears. The film's blend of horror and fantasy elements with a deeply personal drama offers a unique take on the genre, making it a memorable, if imperfect, viewing experience.  \n\n  ",

    "news1": "Matthew Vaughn directs and produces Argylle, a 2024 spy action comedy film created by Jason Fuchs. The film's ensemble cast includes Bryce Dallas Howard, Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O'Hara, Henry Cavill, Dua Lipa, Ariana DeBose, John Cena, and Samuel L. Jackson. The narrative revolves around Elly Conway, a reclusive novelist who becomes enmeshed in the realm of espionage as her latest spy novel begins to match real-world occurrences. The film was shot in several European locales between August and December 2021. It debuted on January 24, 2024, at the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London, and was then distributed in the United Kingdom and the United States by Universal Pictures and Apple Original Films on February 1, 2024 and February 2, 2024, respectively. Despite its star-studded cast, the picture garnered mostly poor reviews and made more than $96 million worldwide on a $200 million budget.\n\n Argylle is a separate spin-off from the Kingsman franchise, with a crossover planned as part of Vaughn's wider spy-focused shared world. The narrative opens with Elly Conway, an introverted espionage author who is ready to finish her sixth book about Aubrey Argylle. Elly experiences writer's block after receiving negative comments from her mother, Ruth. While on a train to see her parents, Ruth and Barry, Elly is saved from an ambush by a genuine spy called Aidan Wilde. Aidan warns her that a shady group known as the Division has targeted her because her novels appear to anticipate their future behavior. Aidan takes Elly to England in the hopes that her next chapter may provide a means to halt the division. \n\n In London, Elly and Aidan search for a 'Masterkey' referenced in her novels, which could expose the Division. When Elly suspects Aidan might also want to kill her, she calls her parents for help. Upon their arrival, Aidan reveals that her parents are actually operatives of the Division, forcing Elly and Aidan to fend them off and flee. They escape to France, where former CIA deputy director Alfie Solomon explains that Elly is not just a novelist but in fact, Rachel Kylle—agent Argylle. Rachel was captured and brainwashed by the Division five years earlier, made to believe that Ruth and Barry were her parents. Her stories are a means of reliving her suppressed memories, including characters based on actual individuals such as Aidan (Wyatt) and Alfie (her cat). \n\n Aidan and Rachel travel to the Arabian Peninsula to get the Masterkey, but are apprehended by the Division. Ritter, the Division's director, admits Rachel was a double agent and one of their most devoted assets. Rachel appears to be loyal, shoots Aidan in non-lethal regions, and claims to be tracking down Alfie for the Division while really delivering him the Masterkey. Aidan and Rachel rejoin to fight their way through the Division's headquarters, a cargo ship. During the struggle, Rachel's cat claws Ritter's eyes out, and Aidan and Rachel utilize the satellite link to transmit the Masterkey. Ruth uses a mental code to get Rachel to assault Aidan, but she is murdered by Keira, a former CIA agent who was assumed dead and has featured in Rachel's writings. \n\n After successfully sending the Masterkey, Aidan blows up the Division's oil ship headquarters. Rachel resumes her literary role by releasing her final Argylle novel. Argylle's true identity is revealed during a reading, which surprises Rachel. In a mid-credits scene set twenty years ago, a young Argylle is shown to be a Kingsman agent, and the first novel is based on his life.  \n\n Argylle is a story that combines espionage with fiction, following the journey of an author who finds her actual identity as a spy. Despite its ambitious concept and high-profile actors, the film's execution received mixed reviews, but it establishes the groundwork for a fascinating shared universe in the spy thriller genre.  \n\n  ",

    "news1": "'Trigger Warning is a 2024 American action thriller film starring Jessica Alba as Parker, a highly talented Special Forces member who inherits her father's pub following his unexpected death. Mouly Surya makes her English-language directorial debut, while the screenplay was written by John Brancato, Josh Olson, and Halley Gross. Thunder Road Films and Lady Spitfire co-produced the picture, which stars Mark Webber, Tone Bell, Jake Weary, Gabriel Basso, and Anthony Michael Hall.\n\n Thunder Road Films initially bought the spec script for Trigger Warning in June 2016, and Netflix acquired the film in May 2020. Several important casting announcements were announced in September 2021, and filming occurred in New Mexico. Netflix released the film on June 21, 2024, but it garnered mostly poor reviews from critics. \n\n The narrative revolves around Parker, a CIA military combatant and investigator who is on a mission in Syria when she receives a call from her hometown's sheriff and ex-lover, Jesse Swann, notifying her that her father, Harry, perished in a mining accident. Parker returns to her hometown of Creation, New Mexico, for the burial, inherits her father's saloon, Maria's, and begins to think Harry's death was not an accident.  \n\n Parker reunites with old friends and faces new foes while settling his affairs. She has a conflict with Jesse's younger brother Elvis and saves a hardware shop owner from robbers. Her suspicions are heightened when she sees Elvis and his goons on her family property, shooting firearms. Parker contacts her buddy Spider, who discovers that Elvis is a dark web weapons dealer who sells armaments to terrorists. Parker reconnects with Jesse and meets his father, Senator Ezekiel Swann, who is fighting for re-election. Spider informs Parker during Harry's funeral that Elvis' men are trespassing in Harry's mine. Confronting them causes her tavern to burn down, killing one henchman and leading to Parker's arrest.  \n\n  Jesse confronts Elvis, confessing that they have been exploiting Harry's mine to smuggle weapons from a neighboring military depot, therefore supporting Ezekiel's campaign and Jesse's sheriff post. Harry's discovery of their enterprise resulted in his murder, which the Swanns concealed as a mining accident. Ezekiel directs Jesse to assassinate Parker's lawyer and continues the weaponry dealing. After killing the lawyer, Jesse and Ezekiel visit Parker in her jail cell and demand the surveillance video from her bar. Parker flees and hides on Mike's land, where she heals in his hidden cannabis lab. Three days later, Parker tries to alert the senior officer at the weapons depot about the thefts but is dismissed. \n\n Parker, determined to pursue justice, prepares enough weaponry to confront the Swanns with the assistance of his buddies Mo and Frank. Parker infiltrates the Swann property, confronts and kills Ezekiel, bringing the film to a close. Spider arrives to aid, but is met with pushback by Ghost's goons. Parker distracts the goons by blowing up a weapons truck, allowing her and Spider to overcome them and murder Elvis. In the final encounter, Jesse enters armed with a grenade, ready to regain power. Realizing his condition is hopeless, he blows himself up, allowing Parker to move on. A month later, Parker and Spider are on their way back to their CIA positions when Mikey sends them a video update on Maria's bar's rebuilding efforts.  \n\n  Trigger Warning depicts a never-ending quest for justice, combining action and thriller elements to highlight Parker's journey from pain to resolution.

    "head1": "Synopsis",
    "news1": "'This claustrophobic thriller takes place almost exclusively within the boot of a leased car traveling along a barren Texas highway. Bride Amanda (Katharina Sporrer), still dressed in her huge white bridal gown, is abducted in the parking garage while returning the automobile she borrowed to leave her own wedding. Fortunately for Amanda—and for the film's tension—she has her cell phone with her. She initially calls what she assumes to be emergency services, only to learn she is speaking with her captor (Caspar Phillipson). This surprise sets the tone for a stressful and nerve-racking experience. \n\n Despite its all-American location and accents, this picture is produced by a Danish film studio led by writer-director Jonas Kvist Jensen. Jensen's oeuvre consists mostly of short films and a few horror/thriller movies, most of which are in Danish. This film, which features English language, looks to be Jensen's calling card, demonstrating his editing, scripting, and suspense-building abilities. Katharina Sporrer gives a respectable portrayal as Amanda, conveying the character's desperation and ingenuity. However, the remainder of the cast's performances are hindered by awkward line readings, which a more experienced or native English-speaking actor might have avoided. As a result, the supporting characters often appear to be from a radio play rather than a film.  \n\n The script's flaws are highlighted by its ambiguous and flimsy explanation of Amanda's kidnapping. Jensen appears to prioritize technical matters such as camera angles and lighting above fleshing out story specifics. Nonetheless, Amanda's character stands out for her outstanding ability to maintain composure and find coping mechanisms in the face of scary situations, such as when her kidnapper inserts lethal critters like a scorpion and a rattlesnake into the boot.  \n\n  Amanda's strength of character and tenacity make her an easy heroine to cheer for, despite her complicated history, which includes serious father difficulties. Her tenacity and creativity come through, allowing viewers to sympathize with her situation and root for her survival. The film would have done well to recognize her strength by referring to her as 'the woman in the trunk' rather than 'the girl,' highlighting her maturity and determination.  \n\n  Overall, Jonas Kvist Jensen's thriller successfully uses its confined location to create a stifling sense of tension and dread. While the supporting cast's performances and narrative clarity fall short, Katharina Sporrer's portrayal of Amanda grounds the picture with a striking blend of sensitivity and strength. Jensen's technical brilliance is clear, and despite its imperfections, the film provides a captivating experience that keeps the spectator immersed in Amanda's perilous voyage. \n\n",

    "news1": "'Kaagaz 2' tells the moving story of Sushil Rastogi, a middle-class parent whose life takes a terrible turn when his daughter dies at a political protest. Satish Kaushik plays Rastogi, a clerk in the water supply department who starts on a never-ending search for justice against the irresponsible officials and a strong political figure guilty for his daughter's murder. \n\n The film depicts Rastogi's emotional journey and dedication, as evidenced by his partnership with lawyer Raj Narayan Singh (Anupam Kher) and Singh's son (Darshan Kumar). Kher's portrayal of the experienced lawyer skillfully highlights the complexity of legal disputes and the difficulty of battling institutional faults. The courtroom drama unfolds as Rastogi and Singh battle to reveal administrative inefficiencies and demand accountability.   \n\n  Parallel to Rastogi's fight, the story introduces Uday Raj Singh (Darshan Kumar), a cadet in the Indian Military Academy. Uday's unrelenting devotion to justice gets him in difficulty when he intervenes to protect a woman from harassment, which results in disciplinary action at the school. Neena Gupta's portrayal of Radhika, Uday's mother, deepens the familial relationships by emphasizing her unwavering support while living apart from her husband (Anupam Kher).  \n\n  The film's core topic is the awakening of society consciousness via personal sorrow. It investigates how individuals frequently realize institutional injustices only when they are personally touched by them, providing a sad reflection on the difficulties regular citizens experience while negotiating bureaucratic red tape and political apathy.  \n\n  While 'Kaagaz 2' effectively depicts the emotional toll of personal loss and the resilience required to challenge authority, some critics have noted that the storyline is occasionally disjointed, limiting its ability to deliver a cohesive social message about the implementation and execution of laws.  \n\n Overall, Satish Kaushik's directing creates a fascinating tale that combines human drama with societal commentary. Satish Kaushik, Anupam Kher, Darshan Kumar, and Neena Gupta's performances enhance the picture by portraying loss, tenacity, and familial relationships in subtle ways that resonate with spectators.   \n\n  Finally, 'Kaagaz 2' demonstrates the unwavering spirit of those battling for justice despite overwhelming circumstances. It emphasizes the ability of human narratives to inspire greater societal change, encouraging audiences to consider the role of empathy and action in tackling structural injustices. This synopsis captures the core of 'Kaagaz 2,' emphasizing its thematic complexity, character interactions, and narrative virtues while also recognizing its occasional narrative flaws. \n\n",

    "news1": "At this moment the whole world is thinking only about one thing, what is the role of Prabhas in Kalki 2898 AD, is it Kalki herself or Lord Shiva's incarnation Bhairava? Nag Ashwin himself gave the answer and also revealed the biggest hint of the film's story till date. Made such dangerous planning that your senses will be blown away. This is the biggest complaint of the fans about the makers of the film. They are not promoting it at the level it actually deserves, so the team of the film has silenced everyone by putting out a new promotional content. This is a sensible thing. For the sensible audience, a video named Prelude of Kalki has come which Actually it's like an introduction just before we step into Kalki's world and I'm sure. Believe the detailing with which Nag Ashwin is explaining each and every thing, on 27th June, Day One of Indian Cinema, all box office records finished RIP, first of all, watching this video will clear the doubts of those people who are thinking that That tomorrow's Adi Purush 2.2 is not going to be made, there are Boss God level visuals in this short video. \n\n A completely different world has been created, if your eyes tear up just after seeing the sketches, then what will happen in the theatre? Ashwin has started the video by saying that his film is like a sequel to Mahabharata, everyone knows what happened in Mahabharata and what next after that. The story of Kalki is going to start from here, the first scene of the film is probably Mahabharata. There will be a climax of the battle in which Lord Krishna himself can be seen. Yes, let me tell you an inside news, I have come to know that there are going to be not one, two, three but at least 15-20 small but powerful cameos inside Kalki. You should understand one thing very clearly that the character of Ashwathama is appearing again and again in the teaser trailer. The one who impressed everyone the most is only on 1. If we consider the actual film, it is not just Ashwat Dhama in the story. All the characters names you have heard in Mahabharata will be in the film. This is where point number two comes from when Nag Ashwin himself started his film. DC is calling it a competition to Hollywood giants like Marble Star Verse. There is overconfidence and not self-belief. They have confidence in their mythology and sci-fi topic due to which a film about a superhero's father has been made. Look, Nag Ashwin wants to give us in theaters what Ramayana and Mahabharata have been explaining to people for many years.   \n\n  The battle of good versus evil and this is where the biggest secret lies. He revealed this when he told that to end every war, a God incarnates who decides victory or defeat, just as Lord Krishna had defeated the Kauravas by supporting the Pandavas in the Mahabharata, but Kalyug is the same battle. It had already started in Kalki that the battle of Heroes vs Villains would be fierce. As it happens just before ending every era, understand Ramayana Mahabharata and 99 It is confirmed that in this battle, the one who is going to captain the heroes is Prabhas i.e. Bhairava who will be the incarnation of Lord Shiva, here Ashwathama will also be in his team along with others. All Chiranjeevis who have been blessed with immortality are the final battle of Kaliyuga. Kamal Haasan Sir will be the captain of the team of the opposite villain who will take part in it. Whether he is Asur Kali or not is a question of a different level, its answer will probably be found only in the theaters and when the final battle of Heroes vs Villains is going on, then this battle will take place. The 10th and last incarnation of Lord Krishna, Lord Kalki, will enter the Empire. This means bad. The news may be that in the first part of the Kalki film, we may not be told who is actually going to be Kalki.  \n\n  Part one of the project will end there when the whole world will come to know that Kalki has taken incarnation on earth. But his darshan will not happen before part two. Nag Ashwin is clearly telling about the fight. He will start Kalki in 2898 AD, Kalki will be brought into the film only to decide its climax, not before that. Now do not think that Prabhas's character has been wasted, his role is completely useless when he is not from yesterday. So how did he become the hero of this story? Have you read Mahabharata in TV serials? So you must have seen that Lord Krishna only shows the path and by following it, Arjun becomes the biggest hero of this fight. You understand that Prabhas is going to be the Arjun of this Kaliyuga, to show the path, Lord Kalki will be entered in the part two of the film. Actor Who Am I? I don't know at all who used to say this till today, not just Raja Mauli, Prabhas. Just like actors know how to use themselves, Prabhas's career will end without them. The way boss Nag Ashwin has planned to make Prabhas the biggest hero of Kalyug, it can be 10 times bigger than Baahubali. The fight of Baahubali is just Starts from the Kingdom of Mahishmati and ends in Kalki. Prabhas will fight for the whole world, do you understand? Well, one more thing that I have noticed in this video is that till now we are focusing only on the future, how the film will show the story of 500-600 years ahead but the real game of Nag Ashwin is in the past. They will also recreate the old era hidden in which there is a small hint of Amitabh Sir's Ashwathama. The look was that Nag Ashwin has spent 5 years in writing this film, what do you think, not just one part, the story will end within three hours, absolutely not, Kalki 2898 AD is just an introduction to the Kalki Universe, the next chapter of which will be the most important. Because Kalki will be standing there with Prabhas, come and see immediately. That Kalki's new video will make you understand why I am so excited about this film. This prelude video will make many people displeased with Bhairava Anthem. Be ready on 27th June. Dinosaur is coming. You may have liked something in the rest of the video or else. If you have any complaint then wait for me, I will meet you in the next video. take care bye bye",

    "news1": "Kabir Rishi, a chartered accountant, and his wife Jyoti live in Dehradun, Uttarakhand, with their two daughters, Janhvi and Dhruv. During a vacation at their isolated hill station home, they meet Vanraj Kashyap, an enigmatic figure. Vanraj gives Janhvi a laddu in exchange for her paranthas. After swallowing it, Janhvi begins to follow Vanraj's every instruction. Later, he offers her a packet of biscuits and instructs her to consume them when she arrives at the farmhouse. \n\n While relaxing in the farmhouse pool, Jyoti lays her wet phone in a rice box to dry. Vanraj comes at the door, stating that his phone's battery has died. Despite her concerns, Janhvi welcomes him enter. Vanraj talks to Janhvi about her life, generating family friction. When Dhruv interrupts jokingly, Vanraj directs Janhvi to threaten him, resulting in a deadly incident on the swing. Kabir and Jyoti intercede, insisting that Vanraj leave. He confesses that he entranced Janhvi with dark magic, forcing her to obey his every command. \n\n Vanraj's grip on Janhvi tightens, commanding her to damage phones, cut phone lines, and conduct odd deeds. Janhvi smacks her father under Vanraj's order. He demands Janhvi be turned over, threatens Dhruv, and instills fear.Jyoti calls the cops discretely. Vanraj threatens to have Janhvi ignite the gas cylinder if the truth is disclosed. The police depart unnoticed. Kabir gives Vanraj money to save them, but he burns it, showing his demonic nature and thirst for world dominance. Vanraj torments Janhvi, forcing her to self-harm and dance. He forces Janhvi to strip, which sparks Jyoti's attack. Kabir restrains Janhvi and confronts Vanraj, who tells her to laugh till she dies. \n\n Vanraj orders Janhvi to assassinate Dhruv, imprisoning her parents and following her. Dhruv survived the fall. Desperate, they agree to hand up Janhvi to Vanraj.Jyoti brings Dhruv to the hospital, while Kabir tracks for Vanraj's hiding place. He discovers Janhvi and the other captivated girls. Vanraj prepares for a ceremonial sacrifice. Kabir steps in, using Vanraj's recordings to release the ladies. The police successfully bring the girls home, but Vanraj flees.  \n\n A year later, Kabir insults Vanraj, who is being held hostage. He pledges to see Vanraj again, expressing his paternal authority. The terrifying story of Kabir Rishi and his family's meeting with Vanraj Kashyap at their rural farmhouse in Dehradun unfolds as a horrific tale of otherworldly influence and parental determination. What began as a peaceful family vacation quickly turned into a nightmare when they met Vanraj, a guy whose seemingly harmless actions of providing sweets to Janhvi in exchange for her meals revealed a dangerous power: the capacity to enslave minds by black magic.  \n\n As Vanraj's hold over Janhvi strengthened, so did the horror inside the Rishi family. Orders to break communication links and carry out unpleasant deeds arrived quickly, leaving Kabir and Jyoti anxious to defend their children from this terrible entity. The police's unintentional departure following a distress call further exacerbated their isolation and terror. Vanraj's true motives became obvious when he turned down Kabir's money offer, showing his demonic nature and megalomaniac ambition to conquer humanity. His psychological torment of Janhvi, which forced her to hurt herself and obey his every instruction, pushed the Rishis to their breaking point. Jyoti's brave attack on Vanraj, despite the risks, temporarily interrupted his control, but not before he ordered Janhvi to do a heinous crime on her own brother, Dhruv.  \n\n  The family's agony reached a climax when Kabir, motivated by his father's love and despair, followed Vanraj to his lair, where he found the magnitude of Vanraj's depravity: hundreds of brainwashed females, including Janhvi, were preparing for a ritual sacrifice. With ingenuity and bravery, Kabir exploited Vanraj's own recordings against him, liberating the girls from his evil influence and securing their safe return home thanks to police involvement. Despite Vanraj's escape, Kabir's resolve remained unwavering. A year later, he encountered Vanraj in captivity, ridiculing the now-voiceless man who possessed scary power. Kabir's ultimate act of disobedience highlighted a tragic truth: genuine power is found not in supernatural supremacy, but in unflinching love and protection for family. As he left Vanraj to his destiny, Kabir promised that their paths would cross again, exhibiting a firm conviction in justice and the strength of familial relationships.  \n\n  ",

    "news1": "Maidaan, At the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, the Indian national football team loses badly to Yugoslavia, 10-1. Members of the All India Football Federation blame Syed Abdul Rahim, the team's coach, for the dismal performance. Despite criticism, Rahim begs permission to assemble a new team with fresh talent. While other federation members, particularly Subhankar, are hesitant, Anjan, the federation's President, supports Rahim and gives him the necessary approval. \n\n Rahim goes on a countrywide hunt for great players, eventually assembling a squad that includes Tulsidas Balaram of Secunderabad, Peter Thangaraj of Hyderabad, and P. K. Banerjee and Chuni Goswami of Calcutta, among others. However, Roy Choudhary, a renowned journalist from Calcutta, bears a resentment against Rahim for picking only a few Calcutta players.  \n\n In the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, the Indian squad will meet Australia. An Australian player disrespects Neville D'Souza, who responds by scoring a hat-trick, propelling India to a surprise 7-1 win. The squad finished in fourth place, a remarkable accomplishment. Despite their achievement, Roy Choudhary and Subhankar plot to remove Rahim from his post.  \n\n At the 1960 Summer Olympics, the Indian team draws 1-1 with France, the world's top team, and fails to qualify for the next round. The federation eliminates Rahim as coach due to underperformance. Rahim is later diagnosed with lung cancer as a result of his smoking habit and is informed he has just a little time left.  \n\n Rahim is encouraged by his wife, Saira, to follow his ambition of leading the Indian team to a gold medal. He asks to coach the squad again, pledging to stand down permanently if he fails. Despite early opposition from Subhankar, now the President, Rahim obtains the backing of other federation members and is permitted to coach the squad once more. \n\n Rahim trains the squad for the 1962 Asian Games in Jakarta, despite budget difficulties. Rahim persuades Finance Minister Morarji Desai to grant financing on the condition that only 16 players, excluding his son Hakim, attend. Thangaraj, the squad's goalie, gets injured and replaced by Pradyut Barman, weakening the team. \n\n After losing their first match against South Korea, the squad, led by Rahim, regroups and learns the value of formation and cooperation. They beat Thailand 4-1, playing aggressively after teammate Jarnail Singh was hurt. An Indian diplomat's criticism of Indonesia's exclusion of Israel and Taiwan sparks demonstrations against the Indian delegation. \n\n On the day of the final match versus South Korea, the squad is targeted by protestors and requires military protection. Despite his declining health, Rahim gives an uplifting message to his team. His resolve wins over Roy Choudhary, who begins to support the squad. Thangaraj and Singh rejoin the squad, which wins the match 2-1, giving India its sole gold medal in football at the Asian Games. \n\n Syed Abdul Rahim's relentless devotion and strategic vision revolutionized Indian football, culminating in a historic triumph at the 1962 Asian Games. His narrative demonstrates the power of perseverance and the influence of inspiring leadership.",

    "news1": "Murder Mubarak, Netflix's latest murder mystery, is a riveting 142-minute story full of suspense, intrigue, and a stunning twist conclusion. Set against the sumptuous backdrop of The Royal Delhi Club, the film reveals the sinister side of its supposedly rich members. \n\n The story begins with the discovery of the dead corpse of Leo Matthews, the club's fitness trainer, who was brutally killed in the gym. This tragic act catches the attention of Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Bhavani Singh and Sub-Inspector Padam Kumar, who are entrusted with solving the murder mystery.  \n\n As Bhavani and Padam dig deeper into the inquiry, they discover a slew of secrets that the club's members have frantically sought to conceal. The Royal Delhi Club, with its extravagant display of riches and power, is shown to be a front for a slew of illegal activities, including blackmail, drug addiction, and financial deception. The narrative unfolds when two more people, along with a cat, fall prey to the same unexplained circumstances that killed Leo. Bhavani is determined to reveal the culprit, thus the inquiry becomes increasingly urgent.  \n\n The investigation takes a dark turn when Bhavani hears about Guppie, one of the other murder victims, who was discovered attempting to melt the bones of a skeleton buried beneath a garden. Initially, club members speculated that the skeleton belonged to Ajay Kumar, the aggressive and drug-dealing husband of Ganga, the club maid. When Padam realizes Ajay is still alive, he disproves this hypothesis.  \n\n DNA investigation confirms that the skeleton belongs to Anshul, who was married to Bambi, one of the club's wealthiest and most colorful members. This revelation adds another layer of intricacy to the investigation, with Bhavani suspecting a deeper motivation behind the killings.  \n\n In a calculated effort, Bhavani seeks to blame Yash, another club member, for all three deaths. He fabricates a tale in which Yash, motivated by jealously, covertly taped footage of Bambi and murdered Anshul to eliminate his competitor. This created tale, on the other hand, is a brilliant attempt to compel a confession from the genuine offender. The disguise works, and Bambi, under duress, admits to the crimes. Her motive is based on a complex web of envy, greed, and a desperate attempt to preserve her opulent lifestyle. Bambi's arrest puts the inquiry to a dramatic finish, with law enforcement finally apprehending \n\n Murder Mubarak is a masterpiece in suspense, combining complex human interactions with a narrative that keeps viewers guessing until the very end. The film's treatment of topics such as greed, deception, and the veneer of prosperity enriches its compelling story. The surprising conclusion not only shocks but also ties together the story's many hints, making it a must-see for genre enthusiasts.  \n\n Murder Mubarak stands out as a riveting addition to Netflix's murder mystery repertoire, thanks to superb performances, particularly from the actors portraying ACP Bhavani Singh and Bambi. The film not only entertains, but it also raises questions about the extent people will go.  \n\n ",

    "news1": "Crew 2024 is a riveting thriller about three hard-working women who become entangled in a web of deception, desperation, and peril. Their fates connect as they traverse improbable scenarios, resulting in an explosive story of survival and intrigue. \n\n The narrative starts with a sense of urgency and dissatisfaction. 'Where's the gold?' Where's the gold? Gold? 'Gold? Gold?' is a frantic scream for money and security, which appear to be ever-elusive. The entrance of Vijay Walia, Chairman of Kohinoor Airlines, sets the tone for the battle. He tells the workforce, We want to bring everyone onboard. Hello, My name is Vijay Walia. Chairman of Kohinoor Airlines. When will we receive our salaries? We'll get all of our overdue bills paid next week thanks to the Diwali bonus. But the doubt is palpable: We won't even get a box of sweets for Diwali, and you're dreaming of a bonus. \n\n  Jasmine, one of the major protagonists, is going through her own challenges. 'You haven't paid the rent for six months,' she is reminded. She thinks on her years of hard labor and feels deceived by the system: We worked like maids for 20 years. We allowed them to deduct their taxes. Then the provident fund. We let them screw us over. 'Is our company bankrupt?' Mr. Bindra confirms the terrible truth, asking, 'Madam, what are you saying? Swear to Mother Goddess, Mr. Bindra. We are bankrupt. I swear to God, we're bankrupt.' \n\n  In this time of financial disaster, Rajvanshi sir begs Jasmine to exhibit kindness. But desperation promotes audacity. 'Scoundrel. Will we keep it? Are you out of your mind? 'If we are caught, they will ban us from the airport, let alone an airplane,' she claims. The disclosure of hidden money raises tension: Mr. Mittal, you turned out to be such a sly man. We don't have enough money to purchase cookies, but you're making a fortune. \n\n The trio considers the unfathomable. 'Help us, too, sir. Will you be able to accomplish it? We're going to live it up today like the wealthy.' However, their scheme is dangerously close to failure. 'Where are you going?' To do an unusual dance. I want to see. Comedy? Someone knows about us. The meeting with customs is nerve-racking. 'What are you doing here?' -Customs. Customs? What's inside the bag? Shit.  \n\n  The film depicts the metamorphosis that money may cause. 'Sethi, ma'am.' Money may transform anyone into a gangster. How does he simply get away? 'Because he is rich, baby.' The catastrophic repercussions of inequality are well demonstrated. 'Oh, shit.' Take a look at Titanic. The wealthy escaped on boats. Who had to drown? The department has received some type of tip. You're going nowhere, lady. I'm afraid. Then sing. Which one? 'Gold. 'So much gold.' \n\n  Amidst the pandemonium, Geetu, a competent pilot, is caught in a moral quandary. Geetu. You're a talented pilot who excels at everything. But I can't do it. 'Fly the airplane.' The stakes are high as they await confirmation of the tip: 'Is the tip confirmed?' Solid. 'Does the jail have internet?' \n\n As tensions rise, their destiny hangs in the balance. 'Please take a seat, sir.' They said they were preparing for an arrest. Arrest? You. 'Sit, moron.' Fear, courage, and the unwavering desire of a better life propel the story to its climax.  \n\n Crew 2024 is a compelling narrative of tenacity and the lengths regular people will go when pushed to their limitations. It emphasizes the plight of individuals stuck between economic disparities and the hazardous attraction of quick money. Through comedy, suspense, and raw emotion, the film creates a realistic image of survival in a society where the line between good and wrong is frequently blurred.",

    "news1": "In Bade Miyan Chote Miyan 2024, two elite troops, each with a tragic background, are sent on a risky mission to protect India from a masked maniac intent on destruction. The stakes are sky-high as a nameless, faceless criminal steals the most lethal weapon ever developed in the country, endangering national security and world peace. \n\n  The villain's terrifying pronouncement sends shivers down the spine: 'The most dangerous enemy is the one who does not fear death.' An enemy without a name, identity, or face, whose sole goal is... revenge. With a chilling malice, he taunts, 'Who are you?' Doom. I'm taking something valuable from you all... I hope you do not mind. \n\n  The desperation is evident. The package is the most potent and lethal weapon ever produced in our country. The world has never witnessed a greater battle. You have three days. You must act soon! As terror increases, the only hope is to send two troops who can match the villain's lunacy and fearlessness. 'To catch this psychopath, we'll need two even larger psychos. We possess the heart of a soldier. And the mind of a demon. Beware of us. Because we are India!' \n\n Our heroes, elite troops with opposing personalities, must work together. 'I'll cover the north, you handle the east,' one orders. The other responds, 'Why would you lead?' The tension is great, but the first soldier insists, 'Because I am the best.' Their contrasts are stark: one is seasoned and mature, while the other is youthful and dynamic; one is powerful and a perfectionist, while the other is quick and fierce. Despite their disagreements, they must find a way to work together.  \n\n  Their goal is hampered by their squad, which includes Captain Misha, a seasoned operator, and Pam, an IT Specialist and covert asset. They work together to trace down the stolen cargo, which ends up in an underground vault in London, setting up a worldwide clash. \n\n  However, the mission is beset with internal turmoil. 'Why don't you both follow orders?' their boss asks. One soldier acknowledges, 'My ego is bigger than my talent,' while another mocks, 'His biggest talent is his ego.' However, they must transcend their differences as the villain's menace grows: The entire of India will bear the repercussions for what you did to me. You believe you are really heroes? 'Try to stop me.' \n\n As they face their adversary, the warriors say, 'This battlefield might be yours... But we are the oldest participants in this game. The name of our regiment is Lions. Long live India!' Their commitment is unwavering. 'The more wounded a soldier of this regiment gets… The more dangerous he becomes.' \n\n The climax is a showdown of wits, strength, and endurance. 'We are very old friends...' We may give and steal each other's life. The soldiers' friendship, formed in the embers of previous fights, is their most valuable asset as they face the disguised villain in a lethal encounter. \n\n The action in Bade Miyan Chote Miyan 2024 is unrelenting, the stakes are tremendous, and the characters' friendship highlights the story's heart. It's an action-packed thriller that highlights the bravery, friendship, and unwavering resolve of two soldiers trying to preserve their country.",

    "news1": "Four years after the tragic death of Isabel Aretas, Detective Mike Lowrey finds a new beginning in his life by marrying his physical therapist, Christine. Their wedding, however, takes an unexpected turn when Mike's partner, Detective Marcus Burnett, suffers a mild heart attack during the ceremony. This health scare sends Marcus into a coma, where he experiences a profound vision of their late captain, Conrad Howard. In this vision, Howard reassures Marcus that his time has not yet come, instilling in him a renewed sense of invincibility upon waking. \n\n Once Marcus regains consciousness, he interprets his vision as a sign that he is invincible. Shortly after, a scandal erupts in the media, revealing that Captain Howard was allegedly involved in corruption with drug cartels. Determined to clear their mentor's name and restore his tarnished legacy, Mike and Marcus embark on a mission to uncover the truth. They are joined by Captain Rita Secada and her new boyfriend, mayoral candidate Adam Lockwood, in their quest for justice. \n\n  Their investigation leads them to visit Mike's son, Armando Aretas, who is serving time for Howard's murder. Armando reveals a crucial piece of the puzzle: Howard was never corrupt, but he was on the verge of exposing those who were. The corrupt officials, fearing exposure, hired Armando and his mother to kill Howard. Armando, seeking redemption, offers to help Mike and Marcus identify the true culprits behind Howard's murder. \n\n  As the trio delves deeper into the conspiracy, they discover that the conspirators are attempting to access Howard's computer. However, a fail-safe mechanism triggers a pre-recorded video sent to Mike and Marcus, warning them about widespread corruption within federal and state law enforcement. In this video, Howard uses the code phrase 'Coke bottle,' leading them to their former hacker colleague, Fletcher. At Fletcher's club, they retrieve a QR code hidden in wall art, unlocking a second video from Howard. However, their success is short-lived as assassins track them down and kill Fletcher. \n\n Meanwhile, Armando faces his own peril as he is attacked by fellow inmates posing as prisoners. Displaying his formidable combat skills, he manages to eliminate them all. Mike and Marcus arrange for Armando to be airlifted to a more secure location in Miami, but the conspirators strike again, causing the helicopter to crash. Despite the crash, Mike, Marcus, and Armando survive, only to find themselves branded as fugitives.  \n\n  With a bounty on their heads, the trio is hunted by law enforcement and criminals alike. Amidst this chaos, U.S. Marshal Judy Howard, Conrad's daughter, vows revenge on Armando for her father's death. The tension escalates as AMMO team members Dorn and Kelly assist Mike, Marcus, and Armando in decoding the clues left by Howard. They uncover that a former Army Ranger turned DEA agent, James McGrath, is the mastermind behind the corruption. McGrath, once tortured by the cartel into betraying his associates, has since become a cartel boss himself. \n\n  The stakes reach their zenith when McGrath kidnaps Christine and Callie, Judy's daughter. He also targets Marcus's family, but Reggie, Marcus's Marine son-in-law, successfully defends them. The team exposes Lockwood as McGrath's accomplice and uses him as bait to rescue the hostages at a dilapidated alligator-themed amusement park. \n\n In a climactic showdown, Lockwood meets a grisly end, devoured by an alligator after attempting to double-cross the team. Mike confronts McGrath, who forces him into a deadly choice between Christine and Marcus. Mike, leveraging Marcus's belief in his invincibility, shoots Marcus in his bulletproof vest, creating an opportunity for Christine and Marcus to break free. In the ensuing chaos, Mike kills McGrath. Judy, meanwhile, prepares to kill Armando but is stopped by Callie, who reveals that Armando saved her life. Judy, reluctantly grateful, spares Armando and lets him escape.  \n\n With the corruption exposed and their names cleared, Mike and Marcus celebrate their victory and newfound freedom. The duo, along with Reggie, cooks food on a public grill, basking in the simple joy of a job well done and the bonds of family and friendship.",

    "news1": "Madgaon Express 2024 depicts the humorous and chaotic story of three childhood friends who go on a long-anticipated journey to Goa. Their enthusiasm is apparent as they go on what they hope would be the experience of a lifetime. They had no idea that their voyage is going to take an unexpected turn. \n\n  'I wanna go to Goa,' one of them exclaims. It's our time! If not now, when? 'After college?' The excitement is palpable as they finally decide to take the trip they've been planning for years. At 21 years old, they've never left Bombay, and the prospect of leaving parental tension behind and establishing their maturity makes them ecstatic. We aren't kids anymore! We are grownups. 'Goa, here we come!' they exclaim, ready to have as much fun as they had on their previous trip. \n\n  However, problems arise right away. One of the companions complains, 'This is unsanitary.' I am allergic. Do you want to torment us? Make us sit in a non-air-conditioned compartment? 'If he dies, what will we tell his mother?' 'Another, more positive, responds, 'Why would I die? The Madgaon Express from Mumbai to Goa offers one of the world's most magnificent sights.' The doubtful companion responds, 'You gonna show us scenic views at night?' 'With a torch?' \n\n As night strikes, the train trip grows increasingly weird. In an unexpected twist, they meet a fascinating stranger. 'Are you a prostitute?' one buddy asks, to which the visitor responds angrily, 'What!' No! My buddies are narrow-minded. 'I prefer...'. Chaos erupts as another acquaintance begins slurring, 'My tongue has gone numb.' 'I can't speak properly.' The terror builds when someone yells, 'Cocaine! Cocaine!' followed by a bewildered, 'Totaine?' What? You mean there's a lot of totaine in the bed?  \n\n  The scenario quickly escalates. OPEN UP! Goa Police. 'Where is my stuff?' asks a harsh voice, while another figure moans, This is one awful rifle! The stuff is mine, and I am taking it. The guys become involved in a labyrinth of cops, criminals, and narcotics, completely perplexed. 'What's going on?' one exclaims. Another reassures, Do not be afraid. I am there. I will take care of you. \n\n The tension reaches a climax with a comical mix-up. I adore Goa. You have 10 minutes, Rambo! 'Don't act tough under the influence,' one friend mocks as they confront the thugs. The criminals' leader, Don Mangola, is mistakenly referred to as Don Mandolin, to which he answers angrily, 'Let us go, brother Mandakini.' Incredulous, the companions chuckle, Mandakini? 'Do I resemble the film heroine to you?' \n\n With each twist and turn, their journey becomes a comic nightmare. 'We couldn't ever get to Goa, and now we can't get out,' one buddy laments. In the midst of the turmoil, they even find themselves in an unusual circumstance in which they must 'walk like a woman and push those oranges up.' They keep falling down.  \n\n Madgaon Express 2024 is a chaotic voyage full of fun, uncertainty, and unexpected surprises. It encapsulates the spirit of young adventure and the unexpected unpredictability of life. As the companions negotiate the chaos, they realize that sometimes the trip is more memorable than the goal.",
