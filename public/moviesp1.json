    "news1": "Tera Kya Hoga Lovely is a 2024 Indian Hindi-language social comedy film directed by Balwinder Singh Janjua and produced by Sony Pictures Films India. The film features Randeep Hooda and Ileana D'Cruz in lead roles and revolves around India's obsession with fair skin. It was theatrically released on 8 March 2024.\n\n The story follows Lovely, whose dark complexion is considered a curse in her life. The film highlights how a girl's complexion and dowry significantly impact her prospects for marriage. When a boy rejects Lovely because of her dark complexion, her father arranges her marriage with someone else for double the dowry. Problems arise when the dowry items are stolen, and a police officer becomes close to Lovely while trying to catch the thieves. \n\n Balwinder Singh Janjua, known for writing films like Saand Ki Aankh and Mubarakan, directed this film and co-wrote the story with Rupinder Chahal and Anil Rodhan. While the film tackles important social issues such as dowry and colorism, it does so in a light-hearted manner, which dilutes the original spirit of the story. As the film progresses towards comedy, it loses its grip on the serious issues it aims to address. \n\n Ileana D'Cruz, playing the role of Lovely, appears for the first time after the news of her becoming a mother. However, her performance does not align with her previous film choices, and she struggles to do justice to the character. The director's choice to cast her in this role is questionable, as a dark-skinned actress might have brought more authenticity to the portrayal of Lovely. \n\n Sony Pictures released this film strategically before the release of Randeep Hooda's first film as a producer and director, Swatantrya Veer Savarkar, hoping to capitalize on the hype around him. While Randeep's Haryanvi accent is commendable, the director fails to extract the best performance from him. Among the rest of the cast, Geetika Vidya, playing a newly married constable, delivers a better performance than Ileana, but Pawan Malhotra disappoints in the role of Lovely's father. Varun Sharma's participation in the film is puzzling, and Karan Kundra and Sunil Dahiya's performances are average. \n\n Overall, Tera Kya Hoga Lovely received negative reviews from critics, who criticized the direction, writing, and performances. Despite its significant themes, the film's execution falls short, resulting in a missed opportunity to address serious societal issues effectively. ",

    "news1": "Tera Kya Hoga Lovely is a 2024 Indian Hindi-language social comedy film directed by Balwinder Singh Janjua and produced by Sony Pictures Films India. The film features Randeep Hooda and Ileana D'Cruz in lead roles and revolves around India's obsession with fair skin. It was theatrically released on 8 March 2024.\n\n The story follows Lovely, whose dark complexion is considered a curse in her life. The film highlights how a girl's complexion and dowry significantly impact her prospects for marriage. When a boy rejects Lovely because of her dark complexion, her father arranges her marriage with someone else for double the dowry. Problems arise when the dowry items are stolen, and a police officer becomes close to Lovely while trying to catch the thieves. \n\n Balwinder Singh Janjua, known for writing films like Saand Ki Aankh and Mubarakan, directed this film and co-wrote the story with Rupinder Chahal and Anil Rodhan. While the film tackles important social issues such as dowry and colorism, it does so in a light-hearted manner, which dilutes the original spirit of the story. As the film progresses towards comedy, it loses its grip on the serious issues it aims to address. \n\n Ileana D'Cruz, playing the role of Lovely, appears for the first time after the news of her becoming a mother. However, her performance does not align with her previous film choices, and she struggles to do justice to the character. The director's choice to cast her in this role is questionable, as a dark-skinned actress might have brought more authenticity to the portrayal of Lovely. \n\n Sony Pictures released this film strategically before the release of Randeep Hooda's first film as a producer and director, Swatantrya Veer Savarkar, hoping to capitalize on the hype around him. While Randeep's Haryanvi accent is commendable, the director fails to extract the best performance from him. Among the rest of the cast, Geetika Vidya, playing a newly married constable, delivers a better performance than Ileana, but Pawan Malhotra disappoints in the role of Lovely's father. Varun Sharma's participation in the film is puzzling, and Karan Kundra and Sunil Dahiya's performances are average. \n\n Overall, Tera Kya Hoga Lovely received negative reviews from critics, who criticized the direction, writing, and performances. Despite its significant themes, the film's execution falls short, resulting in a missed opportunity to address serious societal issues effectively. ",
